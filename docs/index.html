         <h3>My Background</h3>
         <p>Since 2013 I have been part of Geostart, the innovation group of the Institut Cartogràfic i Geològic de Catalunya.</p>
         <p>My work there includes the development of <b>prototypes and the research of new technologies</b>, as well as the design and <b>development of web applications</b> (front-end and back-end).<br> *Some exemples of our work <a href="" target="_blank">HERE</a>. </p>
         <p>More recently I have been mainly focused on the <b>mobile development</b>, being in charge of several application development projects.</p>
         <p>In addition, as part of Geostart I have acquired a wide knowledge of geotechnologies, working as a <b>GIS developer</b></p>
         <p>Last year I finished a postgraduate course in <b>UX Design</b>, aiming to expand my overall vision of the whole development process of a technological product, and complementing my knowledge as a developer, giving it an extra value to the work I do in the projects in which I participate</p>
         <p>This background gives me a very versatile profile and the ability to deal with many different technologies.</p>

               <p>I’ve worked widely as a front-end and back-en developer in the project InstaMaps.cat, an online web platform to create maps with your own data.</p>
               <p>Right now, the platform has about 9,000 users that have created more than 35,000 maps.</p>
               <p>Based in the following technologies:
               <ul>
                  <li>FRONT-END: Javascript + JQuery + Bootstrap and Leaflet.js.</li>
                  <li>BACK-END: Java +  Struts + Hibernate and a PostGIS Database</li>

               <p class="card-text text-justify">
               <p>I’ve fully developed Catalunya Offline, an <b>hybrid mobile app</b> available for Android and IOS, that allows people download the Catalan cartography in their devices and use it in offline mode. Some of the functionalities are: locate you on the map, save waypoints and tracks and add pictures and data to them, load files with external geographical data, and connect all this information with the Instamaps.cat platform.</p>
               <p>Catalunya Offline has been developed with the <a href="https://ionicframework.com/" target="_blank">Ionic Framework</a> (and so, Cordova + Angular).</p>
               <p>Initially it used <a href="https://ionicframework.com/" target="_blank">Leaflet.js</a> + <a href="https://ionicframework.com/" target="_blank">AngularLeaflet</a> for the map functionalities, but now, it’s been refactorized to use <a href="https://ionicframework.com/" target="_blank">MapboxGL.js</a> + WebGL technology, to take advantage of the <a href="https://ionicframework.com/" target="_blank">Vector Tiles</a> system.</p>
               <p>For this purpose, I have developed some interesting new features for the library, in order to make possible to use it in an <b>offline mode</b>: basically, I have added a new VectorTileOffline source and a new RasterOffline source too. Take a look <a href="https://ionicframework.com/" target="_blank">HERE</a>.</p>

               <p>I've fully developed MapICC, an app to visualize and interact with the Catalan cartography in online and offline mode. MapICC has some simple but nice functionalities like locate you on the map, load your own track files, or find places in the map.</p> 
               <p>MapICC it's been developed as a pure Android native application.</p>

         <h3>My skills</h3>
         <br>
         <p>
         Very comfortable developing JavaScript large applications and good knowledge about HTML5 and CSS3/SASS. 
         </p>
         <p>
         Wide experience developing hybrid apps. Until now I’ve been working mainly with the Ionic Framework. But lately I’m moving to React Native + Redux. Actually, right now, I’m working in a new project, developing an app using these technologies. 
         </p> 
         <p>
         Good knowledge of the geo scope: I’ve worked extensively with the Leaflet.js framework and more recently I’ve started to work with the MapboxGL framework too. In fact, I’ve just developed some interesting new features for this library to make possible using it in an offline mode (as I have explained HERE).
         </p>
         <p>
         Not afraid about learning and discover new frameworks and technologies. Actually, I really enjoy doing it! That’s why I always try to make my best to improve my skills, assisting as many conferences, meetups, etc. related with technology as I can, as well as doing courses or reading interesting books and articles.
