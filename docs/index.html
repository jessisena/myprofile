  <h3>My background</h3>
  <p>Since 2013 I have been part of Geostart, the innovation group of the Institut Cartogràfic i Geològic de Catalunya.</p>

  <p>My work there includes the development of <b>prototypes and the research of new technologies</b>, as well as the design and <b>development of web applications</b> (front-end and back-end).<br> *Some exemples of our work <a href="" target="_blank">HERE</a>. </p>

  <p>More recently I have been mainly focused on the <b>mobile development</b>, being in charge of several application development projects.</p>

  <p>In addition, as part of Geostart I have acquired a wide knowledge of geotechnologies, working as a <b>GIS developer</b></p>

  <p>Last year I finished a postgraduate course in <b>UX Design</b>, aiming to expand my overall vision of the whole development process of a technological product, and complementing my knowledge as a developer, giving it an extra value to the work I do in the projects in which I participate</p>

  <p>This background gives me a very versatile profile and the ability to deal with many different technologies.</p>

    	I’ve worked widely as a front-end and back-en developer, in the project InstaMaps.cat,an online web platform to create maps with your own data. Right now, the platform has about 9,000 users that have created more than 35,000 maps. InstaMaps is based in --------. Tecnologies.

    <h4 class="card-title">Catalunya Offline</h4>
    <p class="card-text">
		<p>I’ve fully developed Catalunya Offline, a mobile app available for Android and IOS, that allows people download the Catalan cartography in their devices and use it in offline mode. Some of the functionalities are: locate you on the map, save waypoints and tracks and add pictures and data to them, load files with external geographical data, and connect all this information with the Instamaps.cat platform.</p> 
		<p>Catalunya Offline is an hybrid app initially developed with IONIC (and so, Cordova + Angular) + Leaflet.js. </p>
		<p>But now, it’s been refactorized to use Mapbox GL + WebGL technology, to take advantage of the Vector Tiles system.<br>
		For this purpose, I have developed some interesting new features for the library, in order to make possible to use it in an offline mode. Basically, I have added new a new VectorTileOffline source and a new RasterOffline source too. Take a look HERE.</p>
